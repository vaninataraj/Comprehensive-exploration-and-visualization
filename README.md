# Comprehensive-exploration-and-visualization
This notebook is intended for data exploration and visualization to understand the drivers of customer behavior. I think it is meaningless to analyze the added or removed products by customer because the customer data (such as income, channel used, segment, employee index, customer index, etc.) are identical for the whole period. Hence, we cannot say that the customer has dropped or added a product because his income increased as the income is consistent throughout all months. However, we can analyze additions or substitutions or retention times across alll customers and compare these metrics with customers features such as income groups or channels or whatever. In my attempt here, I analyzed products additions and tried my best to understand what drives the customer to use different types of products.
